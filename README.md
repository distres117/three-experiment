### Summary
This is an ongoing project to create a from-scratch frontend framework for creating basic presentational applications with three.js.  I was inspired by the [ascii effect](https://threejs.org/examples/#canvas_ascii_effect) three.js demo and decided to try to build a resusable framework with pure ES6 javascript and jquery.  The use case was a basic portfolio-type site.  The aesthetic is sparse and meant to evoke the [web-brutalism](http://brutalistwebsites.com) design movement.
